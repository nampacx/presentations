# Presentations

This repository contains public presentations created by me, [@nampacx](https://github.com/nampacx).
The presentations are built using [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) and are available at: [https://presentations.mikokono.de](https://presentations.mikokono.de).

## Structure

- **Entry Point**: 
  - `slides.md` file in the root directory contained an overview of all presentations.
  - all other presentations are located right beside the `slides.md` file in the root directory. Such as:
    - `devcontainer.md` for the devcontainer presentation.
    - `webappLocalizatuib.md` for the full-stack devcontainer presentation.
- **Linked Content**: 
  - shared slides can be  found in the `special-slides` folder
  - special/extracted slides from presentations can be found in the `special-slides/<presentation-name>` folder.
- **Assets**: All images and assets of **all** slides are located in the `public` folder. This is the default location for Slidev to look for assets.

- **Demo Projects**: The `demo-projects` folder contains demo projects that are used in the presentations. These projects are not part of the Slidev framework but are included for demonstration purposes. (each demo project has its own folder name like the presentation name)
